  abstract = {Methods for a graphical representation of determinants are described
	in detail. Three different graphs are discussed and in each case
	an efficient graphical method of matrix element evaluation is given.
	The graphs store information about large determinantal basis sets
	in a very compact form and allow for some insight into the structure
	of such basis sets. A computer representation and some algorithms
	for the graphs are described in the appendices.},
